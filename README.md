# GoogleSignIn
### Version 1.0

GoogleSign-In is a plugin for SuiteCRM

This plugin provides log in functionality using existing google credential rather than creating separate login credential for CRM.

Before moving further, first we need to configure a project in Google Developer console. This is a one time activity. Once you register your project, you'll get **Client ID** and **Client Secret** and those details need to be saved in CRM.

Once you saved those details, then you'll get to see the ***Sign in With Google*** button on login screen. Before logging in using google credentials, kindly make sure that your google email address is stored as the CRM user's primary email address.
